Things to do for the project:

1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWqpTpo1kfw&t=1023s
	watch the video and chnage the Soom repository according to it.
	in addition learn how to connect the repository to visual studio.
	

2) Ways to switch between screens:

	a) inside Form1.cs:	
		this.Hide();
		var form2 = new Form2();
		form2.Closed += (s, args) => this.Close(); 
		form2.Show();

	b) inside program.cs:
		Form1 form1 = new From1();
		Application.Run(form1);
		if (form1.HasInfo())
			Application.Run(new Form2);
			
		
		* HasInfo() is a function inside Form1 that returns true if userInfo != "" and false otherwise.
